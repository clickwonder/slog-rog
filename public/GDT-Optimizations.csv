Agenda for the following month:
• We will persist in making optimizations based on performance trends to continually improve the campaign's effectiveness and efficiency.
• It is worth exploring the possibility of launching ad sets that have not been previously tested. This allows us to uncover new opportunities and potentially tap into untapped audiences.
• We will relaunch ads and ad sets that have shown strong performance in the past. By leveraging successful past campaigns, we can potentially replicate their success and achieve positive results.
• We will conduct research to identify new interest-based audiences. This will help us expand our targeting options and reach a broader audience who may be interested in our offerings.",,"Summary
